#PongJS
PongJS is a learning experience where the goal is to collaborate with another programmer,
preferably a beginner, to create the game of Pong in JavaScript.

To begin, you start with a framework to build the application on, located in the "Start" directory.
Then, when you are finished, compare your final product to the sample in the "finished" directory.

To test the game out, simply browse to "(your repositroy directory)" + "/Start/index.html"
Feel free to fork this repository, and start.

Here are some steps that can be divided up amongst the two programmers to work on.
	
*Getting the paddles on the screen.
*Getting the ball onto the screen.
*Making a controller that you can use to control one of the paddles.
*Making a simulated AI for the other paddle.
*Make the simulated physics to move the ball.
*Make sure the ball and the paddles interact and have colliding properties.
*Setting up the scores.
*Resetting the ball when you score.
*Making sure there is a win condition.
*Create a start up menu.
*Set public settings that users can interact with, like ball speed or paddle size.
*Make a 2 player game mode available.
*Make another controller for the other paddle.
*Create a life based game mode. (Single player game mode: user gets X amount of lives and has to rack up points without getting scored on. Each score against the player = 1 life gone.)
*Create a setting for AI difficulty, and make sure to tinker with the difficulty of the AI paddle (i.e. make easy very slow, speed up the ahrd paddle.)
*Make a way to keep track of the high score of the game.
	
Feel free to do as much or as little as you want, and add any extra steps you might want in your game. 
Maybe even add some kind of particle affects like the ball leaving a trail.
Just remember to have fun with it and make sure to push yourself enough to learn a something new with this project.
